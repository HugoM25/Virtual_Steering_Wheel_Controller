# Virtual_Steering_Wheel_Controller (In development)

<h1> What is it ? </h1>

This project allows the user to manipulate an emulated controller using his hands only.


<h1> How does it work ? </h1>

The parameters used by the controller are : 
- the angle formed with the hands
- the distance between the hands
- the state of the hands ( closed or open palms)
